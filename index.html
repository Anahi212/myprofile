			<h2>Traveling</h2>
			<p>
			I have always had a passion for traveling. This was my first time in Europe and I absolutely loved each and every one of the countries. There is no doubt that being exposed to different cultures, traditions, languages, and life changed my view of life.

			<h2>Learning Languages</h2>
			<p>
			I am from Ecuador, so my first language is Spanish. I moved to the United States when I was 11, where I learned English. During highschool I started taking French and felt "in love" with the language. Although my semester abroad has proven that my French skills have a long way to go, it has inspired me to improve it.

			Personally, I believe that spending quality time with family and friends is an essential part of my personal growth. Through their diverse perspectives, wisdom, and unwavering support, I've learned valuable life lessons, gained new insights, and expanded my horizons, and it just brings happiness to my life!
